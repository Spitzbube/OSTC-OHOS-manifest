=============
.build-recipe
=============

The ``.build-recipe`` job extends the :doc:`bitbake-workspace` job to build a
single BitBake recipe. The recipe is built and all the results are discarded.

Variables
=========

OHOS_RECIPE_NAME
----------------

The name of the recipe to build.

There is no default value, this must be set by the extending job.

Usage Guide
===========

To use this job in your pipeline include the generic build definition file,
``build-generic.yaml`` and define a job with the minimal configuration, as
illustrated below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  build-something:
    extends: .build-recipe
    variables:
      OHOS_BUILD_FLAVOUR: "..."
      OHOS_RECIPE_NAME: "..."
      MACHINE: "..."

Pick the desired ``OHOS_BUILD_FLAVOUR``, ``OHOS_RECIPE_NAME`` and ``MACHINE``.
For discussion of ``OHOS_BUILD_FLAVOUR`` refer to the :doc:`bitbake-workspace`
job. ``OHOS_RECIPE_NAME`` is any BitBake recipe available in the selected
flavour. ``MACHINE`` is desired machine name. Supported values are documented
alongside each flavour in the *meta-ohos* repository.
