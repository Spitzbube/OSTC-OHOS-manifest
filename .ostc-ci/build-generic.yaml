# The workspace pipeline prepares a temporary working directory with the
# combined source tree, prepared by git-repo, and bitbake prepared for
# executing tasks. This workspace is *not* constructed in the default directory
# managed by GitLab, to avoid clashes with a git-repo workflow, it is
# constructed entirely in a temporary directory. There's some logic to store
# and restore the path of that directory (SCRATCH_DIR) between script section
# which run in separate shell processes.
#
# There are two places for integration, apart from the variables that are
# documented below. Adding elements to the "before_script" section can
# customize the workspace before bitbake is initialized. This can be used to
# switch git repositories to other branches, for examples. The "script" section
# initializes bitbake, and allows additional customization, to add or remove
# layers, for example.
#
# Both script section are available as YAML anchors, called workspace-before
# and workspace-do respectively. Keep in mind that GitLab imposes some
# limitation on anchors, so you can reliably only use them one level away, that
# is, in a job that is directly extended by the workspace job. Look at other
# pipelines using this job for inspiration.
#
# This is a pipeline job that is used via the "extends" mechanism below.
# For reference see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html
#
# For practical uses see the pipeline definitions for:
# - https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/manifest (manifest-wide tests)
# - https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/meta-ohos (layer or layer group)
# - https://git.ostc-eu.org/OSTC/OHOS/components/staging/xts_acts (component
#   with existing recipe)

  # This pipeline relies on a container with additional pre-installed software:
  # - git and git-repo program to process the manifest
  # - all of the dependencies of bitbake (basic toolchain, python, many tools)

  # The pipeline relies on being scheduled to a GitLab worker with the
  # following properties:
  # - sufficient amount of disk space (~ 100GB will do).
  # - non-ephemeral disk mounted at /var/shared with even more space (~500GB)
  #   that is shared between runs of this pipeline. This is where the bitbake
  #   download directory and sstate-cache are configured below.
